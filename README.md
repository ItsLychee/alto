# alto, a language-oriented audio organizer

alto is a program that organizes your music based on how you use the language to define
a filepath!

* Support movies/videos/etc?

The only decent route I see at the moment is using NFO files generated by metadata creation tools and
operating off of that, but as the project was originally intended for audio, this is a low priority task, but
I do want to extend this project to be a general purpose media organizer, as there aren't any good solutions out
there anyways.

(video-based files seem to lack useful info about the contents itself)

* Why Rust?

Simple, I wanted to learn Rust and the lofty-rs seems better than dhowden/tag.
