# Preface

This documentation was created with the sole intent on teaching you the
Alto DSL. Documentation for the scope that `cmd/alto` provides will be 
at [alto.md](alto.md). This is separated because the variables and functions you will see in
the executable will not be in the `dsl` directory.

# Feedback

Help with alto can asked in the [/discussions] tab, just be courteous and kind to others. If you
think you found a bug in the parser, open a [new issue](/issues/new).
